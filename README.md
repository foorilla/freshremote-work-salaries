## A dataset of global remote work salaries

This repository is a snapshot of all the remote salary data obtained anonymously through the survey at [freshremote.work/salaries](https://freshremote.work/salaries/) (up until December 2022).

The primary goal is to have data that can provide better guidance in regards to what's being paid globally. So newbies, experienced pros, hiring managers, recruiters and also startup founders or people wanting to make a career switch can make better informed decisions.

For a description of the fields/values contained in the dataset see https://ai-jobs.net/salaries/download/ (different site but with same data format).
